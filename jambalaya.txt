Chicken & Sausage Jambalaya
PREP TIME: 1 Hour
SERVES: 10

INGREDIENTS:

3 pounds cubed chicken
2 pounds sliced smoked sausage
1/4 cup Crisco, bacon drippings, or other fat
2 cups chopped onions
2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped bell pepper
1/2 cup diced garlic
8 cups beef or chicken stock
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup chopped parsley
salt and cayenne pepper
Hot Sauce
5 cups Long Grain Rice, uncooked

METHOD:
In a seven quart cast iron dutch oven, heat Crisco or bacon drippings over medium-high heat. Saut√© cubed chicken until dark brown on all sides and some pieces are sticking to the bottom of the pot, approximately thirty minutes. Don't be shy about browning the chicken as this is very important as the brown color of jambalaya is derived from the color of the meat. Add smoked sausage and stir fry an additional ten to fifteen minutes. Tilt the pot to one side and ladle out all oil, except for one large cooking spoon. Add onions, celery, bell pepper and garlic. Continue cooking until all vegetables are well caramelized, however, be very careful as vegetables will tend to scorch since the pot is so hot. Add stock, bring to a rolling boil and reduce heat to simmer. Cook all ingredients in stock approximately fifteen minutes for flavors to develop. Add mushrooms, green onions and parsley. Season to taste using salt, pepper and Louisiana Gold. I suggest that you slightly over-season since the rice tends to require a little extra seasoning. Add rice, reduce heat to very low, cover and cook thirty to forty-five minutes, stirring at fifteen minute intervals. Do not uncover except to stir.
